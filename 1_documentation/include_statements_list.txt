### Include Statments List ###

An "include" statement is an nginx directive in the core module.
See http://wiki.nginx.org/CoreModule#include.  Please see the notes
there regarding relative path.

The relative path for include statements is relative to the path
of nginx.conf, not the prefix path.  In Debian 7, nginx.conf is
located at /etc/nginx/ so all paths are relative to /etc/nginx/.

For purposes of documentation, a configuration file that uses an
include statement is termed a "calling" file. There are four calling
files in this configuration:

	1. nginx.conf

	2. fastcgi.conf

	3. apps/drupal/drupal.conf

	4. sites-available/example.com.conf

This is a list of the include statements found in each calling file
followed by the line numbers.  A # in front of an include stattement
indicates it is disabled.

Note that the same include statement can appear more than once in
a calling file.  For example, in example.com.conf, the same include
statement appears in both the http and https server sections.
